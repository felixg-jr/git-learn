# Creating a New Branch and Commiting Changes

1. Click on 'main' (this is your main branch) on the bottom left corner of VSCode > Type in the name of your new branch (call if whatever you'd like!) > Click on 'Create new branch...'.
> ![Alt Text](./.images/10.png)
2. Then click on the cloud icon on the bottom left corner to sync your local branch to your remote repository.
